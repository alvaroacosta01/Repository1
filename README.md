**Myocontroller project - Bioinstrumentation and Biosensors**

This biomedical engineering project made in Bioinstrumentation and Biosensors consisted of developing a system capable of providing control signals from electromyographic signals picked up at the surface of the forearm with electrodes. These control signals could, for instance, be used to control the actions of a hypothetical prosthetic hand. Moreover, once we already had the circuit done, we had to amplify these signals and use that information in a practical application as, for example, a videogame controllated with our arms, which had to be also programmed by us.
