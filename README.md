**Myocontroller project - Bioinstrumentation and Biosensors**

This biomedical engineering project consisted of developing a system capable of providing control signals from electromyographic signals picked up at the surface of the forearm with electrodes. These control signals could, for instance, be used to control the actions of a hypothetical prosthetic hand. Moreover, once we already had the circuit done, we had to amplify these signals and use that information in a practical application as, for example, a videogame controllated with our arms, which had to be also programmed by us.

**State of the art**

It is common knowledge that one of the most important applications of biomedical engineering are the creation and implementation of artificial limbs. Nowadays, many scientist are implementing  neuronal and muscular electrical signals in prosthetics control, in order to improve the patient's life. Even though there are many studies regarding this topic, there is a need for alternative methods to improve the controllability and functionality of prosthetic devices, for instance through Myoelectric signals (MES) implementation [1].

**Future applications**

This field has a great future in medicine. An important application would be for instance "Enhanced Prosthetic Control": Continued research in pattern recognition algorithms, machine learning, and neural interfaces may lead to more precise and intuitive control of artificial limbs. This could enable users to perform complex tasks and movements with greater ease and dexterity [2]. But this is just an example of all the application that this field has and the significant impact this would have in our society.

**My Game**

Once we designed and built the circuit to obtain the electric signal through the electrodes, we amplified and monitored it in MATLAB, also transforming it into a mouse movement when moving the arm either to the right or left. Then, we created the game that is uploaded in this repository in order to implement it into a practical application. It consists of a character that tries to avoid the negative falling pieces and tries to catch the positive ones until it arrives to a certain number. Even though it might seem a simple activity, it has let me learn how to create circuits and obtain electrical signals from the muscles and also learn to implement those signals into a practical way, which I find enriching and a nice training for actual biomedical engineering application that I will carry out in the future.

In completing this task, I would like to express my gratitude to Ela Burrull, Lluis Badia and Arnau Company for their invaluable contributions and collaboration.
